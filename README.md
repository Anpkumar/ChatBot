# AI Chatbot

This repository contains an AI-powered chatbot built using Vite, React, Node.js, Express, and JavaScript. The chatbot utilizes the OpenAI API for real-time communication with users. It is designed to simulate intelligent conversations and provide helpful responses based on user input.
# Features
# Real-time Communication: 
The chatbot leverages the Express framework in Node.js to handle real-time communication with users, providing a seamless and responsive chat experience.

# Front-end with Vite and React: 
The chatbot's user interface is built using Vite, a fast and flexible development build tool for JavaScript and React. Vite enables quick development and hot module replacement for an efficient development workflow.

# Natural Language Processing (NLP): 
Powered by the OpenAI API, the chatbot employs advanced NLP techniques to understand and interpret user input. This enables it to generate contextually relevant and meaningful responses.

# Conversation Simulation: 
The chatbot is designed to engage in multi-turn dialogues, maintaining context and providing coherent responses based on the ongoing conversation. It can remember previous user inputs and generate appropriate replies accordingly.

# Customization: 
The OpenAI API offers customization options, allowing developers to fine-tune the chatbot's behavior and responses based on specific requirements. These customization options can be explored and implemented using JavaScript.

# Setup Instructions
To set up and run the AI chatbot, follow these steps:
# Clone the Repository: 
Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/danishdazer/Chat-Bot.git

# Install Dependencies:
 Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies for both the server and client by running the following commands:

 cd Chat-bot/api
npm install cors dotenv express nodemon openai

cd ../client
npm install

# Obtain OpenAI API Key:
 Sign up for the OpenAI API and obtain an API key. Visit the OpenAI website (https://www.openai.com) for more information on how to get started.

# Configure API Key: 
create the .env file in the api directory and create the placeholder value (OPENAI_API_KEY) and assign it OpenAI API key.

# Start the Chatbot: 
Open two separate terminal windows or tabs. In the first terminal, navigate to the api directory and run the following command to start the server:

npm start

In the second terminal, navigate to the client directory and run the following command to start the client:

npm run dev

# Customization
The chatbot's behavior and responses can be customized according to your specific requirements. You can explore the OpenAI API documentation for available options and techniques to modify the chatbot's behavior.

To customize the chatbot, you can:

Adjust the response length or temperature to control the length and randomness of generated responses.

Implement additional pre-processing or post-processing steps to enhance the input or output of the chatbot.

Integrate additional functionalities or APIs to extend the capabilities of the chatbot.

Remember to test and evaluate the changes to ensure the chatbot performs as desired.

# Limitations
While the chatbot strives to provide intelligent and contextually relevant responses, it has certain limitations to keep in mind:

The chatbot's responses are generated based on patterns and information
